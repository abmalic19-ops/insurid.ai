________________________________________
Executive Profile (Regulatory-Aligned)
I am a governance-first enterprise architect with experience across banking operations, AML/financial crime exposure, customer journeys, and AI-enabled systems, focused on designing risk-controlled, auditable, and human-governed workflows.
My work sits intentionally before decision-making and enforcement, ensuring that systems remain explainable, accountable, and compliant with existing regulatory frameworks. I do not automate judgment; I design guardrails that preserve human authority.
I operate at the intersection of:
•	Enterprise architecture
•	Regulatory compliance
•	Risk & controls
•	Customer journeys in regulated environments
My approach is aligned with UAE regulatory expectations, global AML standards, and emerging responsible-AI principles, while remaining implementation-practical for large financial institutions.

Core Value Proposition (Why This Matters to Institutions)
•	Reduce regulatory risk before it materializes
•	Embed compliance into architecture, not as an afterthought
•	Ensure AI-enabled processes remain human-supervised and auditable
•	Support regulators by making systems transparent, traceable, and explainable
•	Enable innovation without destabilizing governance

Professional Experience
Independent Research Lead – AI Governance Frameworks (INSURID)
2025 – Present
Conducted independent research and framework design focused on pre-decision governance, explainability, and auditability in AI-assisted insurance and financial workflows.
Scope & Boundaries (Explicit):
•	No automated approvals or rejections
•	No predictive decision-making
•	No substitution of licensed professionals
•	Governance design only (pre-submission clarity, structure, documentation)
Key Contributions:
•	Designed human-in-the-loop governance models for regulated environments
•	Defined audit trails, escalation points, and override mechanisms
•	Mapped regulatory expectations into system design artifacts
•	Emphasized explainability over outcomes
This work is positioned as exploratory and advisory, not operational deployment.

•	AML and financial crime controls
•	Risk awareness in customer onboarding and servicing
•	Compliance-driven workflows

This foundation informs a practical understanding of how governance operates in reality, not theory.
