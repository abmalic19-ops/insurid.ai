## Purpose
INSURID is a calm, pre-deployment governance infrastructure designed to reduce future risk arising from autonomous AI behavior in regulated environments.
INSURID does not operate autonomously, does not make decisions, and does not replace human authority.
Its sole function is to support human-centered oversight through clarity, explainability, auditability, and controlled system behavior.
INSURID is intentionally designed so that humans remain accountable, institutions remain sovereign, and AI remains bounded.
This framework exists to enable responsible collaboration, early alignment, and risk-aware system design before any deployment is considered.

## professional's decision**.
It supports institutions by:
