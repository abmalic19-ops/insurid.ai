## Legal Positioning

INSURID does NOT make decisions.

INSURID will NEVER:
- Approve or reject claims
- Predict outcomes
- Score users
- Recommend actions
- Replace humans
- Automate underwriting or regulatory decisions

INSURID WILL:
- Clarify
- Structure
- Document
- Log
- Explain
- Stop before decisions

All decisions remain the responsibility of licensed professionals.

## Architecture Boundary

Public View:
Pre-submission clarity only.

Internal Professional View (Role-Gated):

These internal mechanisms are confidential and never exposed publicly.
